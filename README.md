# Phonon

## What is this?

A GUI with similar functionality of the console application [MDE](https://github.com/MontagueM/MontevenDynamicExtractor).

Current capability:

* Scrolling through all dynamic models in the entire of Destiny 2
* Exporting with option for name, folder, and texture extraction

Download and have a look, it should be much easier to use than MDE.

## How do I install and use it?

Do not run Destiny 2 at the same time as booting Phonon for the first time. 

You won't get banned but if they try to read the same package Phonon will not like it.

* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/MontagueM/Phonon/releases/latest/) and run Phonon. 
* You'll need .NET 5.0 installed but most people have that.
* Once it's open select your Destiny 2/packages/ directory. It will tell you if it's wrong.
* Phonon will freeze for a bit after that to generate content manifest which is a one-time-per-update thing.
* After some time it should populate the left bar with a list of packages which can be selected to show their dynamics.
* Exporting can be done by using the Export button on the menu bar.

## Errors

I'll list any common errors that appear here and how to fix them. Please raise any new issues in the Issues tab.

For now the safest thing to do if you encounter any error is to delete the whole program and redownload.

## What does Phonon mean

I wrote Phonon in a couple days procrastinating my solid state physics lectures, and the last thing I covered was phonons. 

It's basically just a term for vibrating atoms, and yes I had to google that.
